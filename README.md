## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rimvydas

- ðŸ”­ I work with AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Terragrunt, Python, Golang
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge in cloud infrastructure, software architecture and MlOps
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about cloud deployments, kubernetes or anything else you see on Discovery Channel!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can optimize cloud costs like a pro, but I still forget to cancel free trials before they charge me
